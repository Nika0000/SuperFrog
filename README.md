# PROJECT_NAME

[![Made with Supabase](https://supabase.com/badge-made-with-supabase-dark.svg)](https://supabase.com)

This project aims to build a scalable and powerful architecture for production-ready Flutter applications. The architecture will be designed to handle various aspects of app development, including UI/UX, state managment, data fetching, and more. By folowing best practices and utilizing efficient design patterns, the goal is to create a robust foundation that can easily adapt to changing requirements and scale with the growth of the application.

# Features

* __Clean Architecture:__ Follows the principles of clean architecture to separate concerns and make the codebase easy to understand and maintain.

* __Modular Design:__ Promotes modular design pattern such as BLoC (Bussiness Logic Component) for batter code organization and reusability.

* __Scalability:__ The architecture is designed to scale effortlessly as the application grows in complexity and features.

* __Internationalization:__ Supports multiple languages and locales to create a globally accessible application.

* __Accessibility:__ Ensures that the application is accessible to users with disablities by following accessibility best practices.
